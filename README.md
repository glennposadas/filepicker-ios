# filepicker-ios
This is a prototype to demonstrate how to use the `UIDocumentPickerViewController` in importing a file from the iCloud or from the local file storage of an iOS/iPadOS device. You can easily do this on MacOS.

Update: While attempting to improve this prototype, I found this one. This is way better than this sample project. Take a look: https://github.com/amangona/SwiftyDocPicker
